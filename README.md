Fixes 3rd Review Udacity
https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/277735
Done : 
After logging out from the application the "Login" button becomes disabled which prevents the user from logging back in. Also, please clear the username and password fields during the log out action.

The button is very hard to see. Consider using different colours.

The button appears disabled, I did not manage to submit my information.

Activity Indicator during the geocoding event.

StudentInformation is a class rather than a structure. 

The application does not display a user-friendlyâ€‹ error message when the Intenet connection is turned off.

The login screen needs to be improved in the following ways

The presentation could be improved in the landscape orientation.
The "Login" button is not visible on the smaller devices.
The "Login" button becomes disabled after application is showing an alert.




4th Review 
https://review.udacity.com/#!/reviews/277815
Done : 
It's not possible to try to login when this happens because you don't enable the button again.

Please remove this unused method.

As per specification this should be a struct.







Practise will surely improve my skills.
